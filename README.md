## How to use
It is very easy to add DZWebBrowser to your projects. Take a look into the sample project.
Hopefully you saved a couple of hours!

### Step 1
```
Import "DZWebBrowser.h" to your view controller subclass.
```

### Step 2
```
Import Apple's SystemConfiguration, CFNetwork, MessageUI and Social frameworks.
```

### Step 3
Create a new instance of DZWebBrowser and initialize with a NSURL.
You also need to embed the view controller into a UINavigationController.
```
NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.google.com/"];

DZWebBrowser *webBrowser = [[DZWebBrowser alloc] initBrowserWithURL:URL];
webBrowser.showProgress = YES;
webBrowser.allowSharing = YES;
webBrowser.resourceBundleName = @"custom-controls";

UINavigationController *webBrowserNC = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:webBrowser];

[self presentViewController:webBrowserNC animated:YES completion:NULL];
```
