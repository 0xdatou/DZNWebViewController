              reign supreme. Here, in a single, human-parsable

              information that has, does, and will ever exist on a

              is very little to go on for Objective-C. (Or if there

              Namespacing is the preeminent bugbear of Objective-C.
              A cosmetic quirk with global implications, the
              language's lack of identifier containers remains a
              source of prodigious quantities of caremad for
              armchair language critics.

              Method swizzling is the process of changing the
              implementation of an existing selector. It's a
              technique made possible by the fact that method
              invocations in Objective-C can be changed at runtime,
              by changing how selectors are mapped to underlying
              functions in a class's dispatch table.

              Associated Objects is a feature of the Objective-C
              2.0 runtime, which allows objects to associate
              arbitrary values for keys at runtime. It's dark juju,
              to be handled with as much caution as any other
              function from objc/runtime.h

              a surprise maps on iOS have gotten quite a bit better
              in the intervening releases. Quite good, in fact.

              Stewardship is an old word. It evokes the ethic of
              public service and duty. To be a steward is to embody
              the responsibilities that come with ownership. It is
              an act that justifies authority through continued
              accountability; both the greatest challenge and
              reward of creating and maintaining a project.

              Amidst revelations of widespread spying by the NSA,
              the concept of metadata has taken an unexpected role
              in the national conversation about government
              surveillance. What is it? And how much does it reveal
              about us and our daily habits? These are questions
              that the American people are asking, and they deserve
              an answer.

              and is well outside the scope of a single article.
              And since most applications don't often interact with
              the file system much beyond simple file operations,
              one can get away with only knowing the basics.

              a target's scheme to enable useful debugging
              behavior, but like a fast food secret menu, they're
              obscure and widely unknown.

              NSError is the unsung hero of the Foundation
              framework. Passed gallantly in and out of perilous
              method calls, it is the messenger by which we are
              able to contextualize our failures.

              Ask anyone who's been around the NSBlock a few times:
              Key-Value Observing has the _worst_ API in all of
              Cocoa. It's awkward, verbose, and confusing. And
              worst of all, its terrible API belies one of the most
              compelling features of the framework.

              iOS development all but requires the use of Xcode.
              And if we're resigned to use an IDE in our
              development workflow, we might as well make the most
              of it, right? So this week on NSHipster, we're going

              The concept of equality is a central point of debate
              and inquiry in philosophy and mathematics, with
              far-reaching implications for matters of ethics,
              justice, and public policy. It is the task of
              programmers to reconcile our logical and physical
              understanding of equality with the semantic domains
              we model.

              effectively self-documenting. Between
              <code>longMethodNamesWithNamedParameters:</code> and
              the explicit typing of those parameters, Objective-C
              methods don't leave much to the imagination.

              <code>WHERE</code> clause and a regular expression,
              provides an expressive, natural language interface to
              define logical conditions on which a collection is
              searched.

              Among the most important architectural decisions made
              when building an app is how to persist data between
              launches. The question of how, exactly, to re-create
              the state of the app from the time it was last
              opened; of how to describe the object graph in such a
              way that it can be flawlessly reconstructed next
              time.

              Perhaps what Apple is most renowned for is its
              consistent track record for creating great
              webservices. From consumer products like MobileMe and
              Ping to developer tools including the Provisioning
              Portal and iTunes Connect, Apple has continued to set
              new standards for convenience, robustness, and
              extensibility.

              Search Kit is a C framework for searching and
              indexing content in human languages. It supports
              matching on phrase or partial word, including logical
              &amp; wildcard operators, and can rank results by
              relevance. Search Kit also provides document
              summarization, which is useful for generating
              representative excerpts. And best of all: it's
              thread-safe.

              Boxing is the process of encapsulating scalars and
              value types with an object container, and is
              primarily used to store those values in collection
              objects—namely arrays and dictionaries. In
              Foundation, the reigning featherweight champion of
              boxing is NSValue.

              Strings are perhaps the most versatile data type in
              computing. They're passed around as symbols, used to
              encode numeric values, associate values to keys,
              represent resource paths, store linguistic content,
              and format information. Having a strong handle on
              user-facing strings is essential to making a great

              Understanding the concept of nothingness is as much a
              philosophical issue as it is a pragmatic one. We are
              inhabitants of a universe of <em>somethings</em>, yet
              reason in a logical universe of existential
              uncertainties. As a physical manifestation of a
              logical system, computers are faced with the
              intractable problem of how to represent
              <em>nothing</em> with <em>something</em>.

              paradigm-changing, but telling the difference takes
              practice. Because we're talking about low-level

              A skilled Objective-C developer is able to gracefully
              switch between Objective and Procedural paradigms,
              and use each to their own advantage.

              Of all the Foundation classes, NSValueTransformer is
              perhaps the one that fared the worst in the shift
              from OS X to iOS. But you know what? It's ripe for a
              comeback. With a little bit of re-tooling and some
              recontextualization, this blast from the past could
              be the next big thing in your application.

              Foundation’s URL Loading System is something that
              every iOS developer would do well to buddy up with.
              And of all of networking classes and protocols of
              Foundation, NSURLProtocol is perhaps the most obscure
              and powerful.

              Address Book. Similar to the Message UI framework,
              Address Book UI contains a number of controllers that
              can be presented modally, to provide common system
              functionality in a uniform interface.

              directives are as central to understanding
              Objective-C's gestalt as its ancestry and underlying
              mechanisms. It's the sugary glue that allows
              Objective-C to be such a powerful, expressive

              C.

              just about knowing obscure gems in the rough.

              Foundation boasts one of the best, most complete
              implementations of strings around. But a string
              implementation is only as good as the programmer who
              wields it. So this week, we're going to explore some
              common uses--and misuses--of an important part of the
              Foundation string ecosystem: NSCharacterSet.

              month, week of year, or whether that month is a leap
              month). However, combined with
