              Open Source communities function within what
              economists describe as a <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">Gift
              Economy</a>. Rather than paying one another for goods
              or services through barter or currency, everyone
              shares freely with one another, and gains <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie">social
              currency</a> based on their generosity. It's similar
              to how friends tend to take turns inviting one
              another over for dinner or a party.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the negligible cost of distributing software
              over the Internet, developers are able to participate
              with millions of others around the world. And as a
              result, we have been able to collaboratively build
              amazing software.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of open source participation, releasing code
              is only one aspect—and arguably not even the most
              important one. Developing an open source project
              requires equal parts engineering, product design,
              communication, and community management. But the true
              deciding factor for whether an open source project
              succeeds is stewardship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stewardship is an old word. It evokes the ethic of
              public service and duty. To be a steward is to embody
              the responsibilities that come with ownership. It is
              an act that justifies authority through continued
              accountability; both the greatest challenge and
              reward of creating and maintaining a project.

              Creating
            </h2>
            <p>
              It's not enough to dump a pile of source code
              somewhere and declare it "open source". To do so
              misses the point entirely. The first step of
              stewardship is to clearly explain the goal and value
              proposition of the project, and establish clear
              expectations going forward.
            </p>
            <h3>
              README
            </h3>
            <p>
              A README is the most important part of any open
              source project. It describes why someone would want
              to use the code, and how they may start to do so. All
              good READMEs have the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A short, one or two sentence introduction that
              clearly explains what the project is in simple,
              understandable language.
              </li>
              <li>A section describing the basic usage of the
              primary tasks of the project. For example, a UI
              component would provide sample code of how to create,
              configure, and add itself to a view.
              </li>
              <li>A list of requirements and instructions on how to
              install the code into one's own project.
              </li>
              <li>Links to documentation and resources for
              additional information.
              </li>
              <li>Contact information for the author or current
              maintainer.
              </li>
              <li>A quick statement about the licensing terms of
              the project.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
              LICENSE
            </h3>
            <p>
              All open source code should be released under an
              appropriate license. Unless you have a really good
              reason not to, choose from any of the licenses
              approved by the <a href="http://opensource.org">Open
              Source Initiative</a>, like <a href=
              "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>,
              <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache

            </p>
            <p>
              If you're unsure which license to choose, there are
              <a href="http://choosealicense.com">several</a>
              <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com">resources</a>
              online that you can use to learn more. Most open
              source Objective-C projects are released under an MIT
              license, which is known to be compatible with the
              terms of distribution for the App Store.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Screenshot
            </h3>
            <p>
              For projects with any kind of user interface, such as
              a custom control, view, or animation, posting a
              screenshot should be considered a requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buying anything "sight unseen" is a bad idea, and the
              same goes for consumers of open source. Although
              there are no monetary costs involved, evaluating a
              project requires a nontrivial investment in time and
              energy. A screenshot helps potential consumers decide
              if your code is worth checking out.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Demo
            </h3>
            <p>
              Actions speak louder than words. And no matter how
              comprehensive a README file is, any open source
              project can be improved with a working example.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's just something about seeing the code in a
              real context that allows developers to grok what's
              going on. It's also nice to have a starting point for
              tinkering around.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the very least, an example can be used to
              bootstrap the process of fixing bugs or developing
              new features, both for you and for anyone who wants
              to contribute. It's also a great place to incorporate
              any testing infrastructure for the project.
            </p>

              Distribution
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the great developments in the Objective-C open
              source community—and in many ways, what has allowed
              it to flourish as it has recently—is <a href=
              "http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              CocoaPods is the de facto dependency manager for
              integrating third party code in iOS and Mac OS X
              projects. At this point, it's pretty much expected
              that any library worth using is distributed with a
              <code>.podspec</code>:

              Maintaining
            </h2>
            <p>
              Once the initial thrill of releasing a library has
              passed, the real work begins. The thing to remember
              is that a flurry of stars, watchers, and tweets may
              be exciting, but they don't amount to anything of
              real importance. Only when users start to come with
              their questions, issues, and pull requests does code
              become software.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Versioning
            </h3>
            <p>
              Versioning is a contract that library authors make to
              consumers in how software will be changed over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prevailing convention is <a href=
              "http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>, in which
              a release has a major, minor, and patch version, with
              each level signifying particular usage implications.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A patch, or bugfix, release changes only
              implementation, keeping the public API and thus all
              documentation intact. Consumers should be able to
              update between patch versions without any change to
              their own code.
              </li>
              <li>A minor, or point, release changes the public API
              in non-breaking ways, such as adding a new feature.
              Again, developers should expect to have consumer code
              between minor versions work pretty much as expected.
              </li>
              <li>A major release is anything that changes the
              public API in a backwards-incompatible way. Updating
              between major versions effectively means migrating
              consumer code to a new library.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                A comprehensive set of guidelines for semantic
                versioning can be found at <a href=
                "http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              By following a few basic rules for versioning,
              developers are able to set clear expectations for how
              changes will affect shipping code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deviating from these conventions as an author is
              disrespectful to anyone using the software, so take
              this responsibility seriously.

            <h3>
              Answering Questions
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of our greatest flaws as humans is our relative
              inability to comprehend not knowing or understanding
              something that we ourselves do. This makes it
              extremely difficult to diagnose (and at times
              empathize with) misunderstandings that someone else
              might be having.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's also a slight sadistic tendency for
              developers to lord knowledge over anyone who doesn't
              know as much as they do. We had to figure it out for
              ourselves (uphill both ways, in the snow) so why
              shouldn't they have to as well?
            </p>
            <p>
              We must learn how to do better than this. RTFM is a
              lame answer to any question. It's also a dead-end to
              a potential learning experience for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than disdaining questions, take them as an
              opportunity to understand what you can do better.
              Each question is a data point for what could be
              clarified or improved within your own software and
              documentation. And one thing to consider: for each
              person who asks a question, there are dozens of
              others who don't and get frustrated and give up.
              Answering one question on a mailing list or developer
              forum helps many more people than just the asker.

              The fate of any successful enterprise is to outgrow
              its original creators. While this may be a troubling
              or unwelcome notion, it is nevertheless something
              that any responsible creator should keep in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              If anything, the reminder that all of this is
              fleeting gives reason to find enjoyment in even the
              minutia of a preoccupation.

              As a project grows, natural leaders will emerge. If
              you see someone consistently answering questions in
              issues or sending pull requests with bug fixes, ask
              if they would like some more responsibility.

              Co-maintainers don't come pre-baked; individuals must
              grow into that role. And that role is something that
              must be defined over time by everyone involved. Avoid
              drama and hard feelings by communicating honestly and
              often with collaborators.

              All software has a lifecycle. At some point, all
              things must come to an end. Libraries outgrow their
              usefulness, or are supplanted by another piece of
              software, or simply fall out of favor. In any case,
              there will come a time when the lights need to be
              turned off, and it is the responsibility of the
              maintainer to wrap things up.

              <li>Announce the ending of the project, offering
              suggestions for how to migrate to another solution.
              </li>
              <li>Keep the project around, but make a commit that
              removes source files from the master branch. (Git
              will keep everything safe in history)
              </li>
              <li>Thank everyone involved for their help and
              contributions.

              The alternative is to become a liability, an
              attractive nuisance... a mockery of what once was a
              respectable code base.

              Creating is one of the most fulfilling experiences in
              life, and it's something that's only improved by
              sharing with others. As software developers, we have
              a unique opportunity to be unbounded by physical
              limitations to help one another.

              On the occasion that you do have the opportunity to
              participate in the community, be sure to make the
              most of it—you'll be happy you did.
